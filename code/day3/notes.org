---- Syntax & Tools  ~ What's the day?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Review map, filter, foldr, foldl --> Tick Tick!
* Familiarty with data declarations
  + Explain each part of a data declaration Properly! You didn't do it properly last time.
  + Explain how exactly (Maybe a) has been defined in the Prelude.
  + Record syntax [Just a side note. Conveience.]
  + Explain what a tree is. Define a tree.
  + Define a few functions on trees. treeSize. treeMap. treeSum. treeDepth. flatten.
  + Define anotherFold for tree. Explain folding as a general concept.
* Defining your own typeclasses
  Examples: Listable typeclass
* IO in Haskell
  + How to do IO in a language that has functions that
    + Do nothing apart from computing their result, i.e. no side effects
    + Don't depend on anything other than their inputs. Same inputs => Same output
  + (IO a) to the rescue
    + Inert simple pure *description* of a process that does something. Not the doing of the thing.
  + Generating IO computations
    putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
    getLine :: IO String
  + Combining IO values
    (>>) :: IO a -> IO b -> IO b
    (>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

  + Monoid
    - What's a Monoid?
    - Examples: numbers and addition
                numbers and multiplication
                diagrams and super-imposition / overlaying
  + Functor
    - Remind all the maps we have used so far.
    - Talk about kinds. A Functor has the kinds (* -> *).
  + Applicative Functor
    - error "To be planned."
  + Monad
    - error "To be planned."
